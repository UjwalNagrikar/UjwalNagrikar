## Projects

### Cloud Infrastructure Automation
`Terraform` `AWS` `Python`

Designed and implemented an end-to-end automated provisioning pipeline for AWS EC2 and S3 resources using Terraform and Python.

- Reduced infrastructure deployment time by **75%** by migrating manual provisioning workflows to fully declarative IaC
- Identified and applied cloud cost optimization strategies, achieving a **30% reduction** in monthly AWS spend
- Established reusable Terraform module library, enabling consistent and auditable infrastructure rollouts across environments

---

### Microservices Container Orchestration
`Docker` `Kubernetes` `YAML`

Architected a containerized microservices platform to support high-availability application workloads.

- Designed and deployed multi-node Kubernetes clusters with automated scaling policies to handle dynamic traffic patterns
- Implemented rolling update and blue-green deployment strategies to achieve zero-downtime releases
- Configured resource quotas, namespaces, and RBAC policies to enforce security and workload isolation

---

### Infrastructure Automation Suite
`Python` `Shell Scripting` `Linux`

Built a comprehensive suite of automation tools for server lifecycle management, monitoring, and disaster recovery.

- Authored provisioning and configuration scripts that reduced manual server setup time across multiple environments
- Developed custom monitoring and alerting integrations with Prometheus and Grafana for proactive incident detection
- Implemented automated backup and disaster recovery procedures, ensuring data integrity and business continuity

---

## Areas of Focus

- Advanced Kubernetes orchestration and service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud deployment strategies
- Security automation and compliance-as-code
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) — SLOs, error budgets, toil reduction
